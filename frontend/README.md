# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup for getting React working with Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and essential ESLint rules.

## Official Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
npm install lucide-react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-draggable
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server with React support, enabling fast refresh for an efficient development experience.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before running the setup.
- You can customize ESLint rules as needed to fit your projectâ€™s requirements.

Happy coding!
